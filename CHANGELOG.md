# [4.11.0] - 2024-12-06

### Changed

* Drop support for PHP < 8.1, Symfony < 5.4 and Symfony 6.0 - 6.3. In future we will drop support for PHP and symfony
  versions as they reach EOL. by @acoulton in [#272](https://github.com/Behat/Gherkin/pull/272)
* Deprecated `ExampleNode::getTitle()` and `ScenarioNode::getTitle()` in favour of new methods with clearer meaning.
  by @uuf6429 in [#271](https://github.com/Behat/Gherkin/pull/271)

### Added

* Added `(ExampleNode|ScenarioNode)::getName()` to access human-readable names for examples and scenarios,
  and `ExampleNode::getExampleText()` for the string content of the example table row.
  by @uuf6429 in [#271](https://github.com/Behat/Gherkin/pull/271)

### Internal

* Enable dependabot for github actions workflows by @jrfnl in [#261](https://github.com/Behat/Gherkin/pull/261)

# 4.10.0 / 2024-10-19

### Changed

- **âš  Backslashes in feature files must now be escaped**\
  Gherkin syntax treats `\` as an escape character, which must be escaped (`\\`) to use it as a
  literal value. Historically, this was not being parsed correctly. This release fixes that bug,
  but means that if your scenarios currently use unescaped `\` you will need to replace each one
  with `\\` to achieve the same parsed result.
