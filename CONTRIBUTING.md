# Contributing

Gherkin is an open source, community-driven project. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to do this, but remember to
follow this few simple rules:

- Make your feature addition or bug fix,
- Always use the `master` branch as base for your changes (all new development happens in `master`),
- Add tests for those changes (please look into `tests/` folder for some examples). This is important so we don't break
  it in a future version unintentionally,
- Commit your code, but do not mess with `CHANGELOG.md`,
- _Remember_: when you create a Pull Request, always select `master` branch as target (done by default), otherwise it
  will be closed.

## Running tests

Make sure that you don't break anything with your changes by running:

```shell
composer test
```

## Running Linters

We use automated tools to ensure that the code has a consistent style and is of good quality.

```shell
composer lint
```

## Contributing to Gherkin Translations

Gherkin supports &rarr;40 different languages and you could add more! You might notice `i18n.php` file in the root of
the library. This file is downloaded and **autogenerated** from
original [cucumber/gherkin translations](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/gherkin/gherkin-languages.json).
So, in order to fix/update/add some translation, you should send a Pull Request to the `cucumber/gherkin` repository.
`Behat\Gherkin` will re-download/regenerate translations from there before each release.

It might sound difficult, but this way of dictionary-sharing gives us the ability to migrate `*.feature` files from
language to language and library to library without the need to rewrite/modify them - with the same (Gherkin) dictionary
used everywhere.
