# Git 2.23+ allows ignoring commits from git-blame, useful to not display large automated commits.
#
# This file is a list of such commits, that you most probably are not interested in.
# To make this work for your local setup, you need to run the following command:
#
# $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# A few rules for changing this file:
# - Commits are in chronological order - oldest on top. Therefore new commits should be added in the end.
# - The purpose is specifically for large commits - avoid adding commits with a very small impact, even if related
#   to automated code style formatting.
# - Each commit should be preceded with a comment detailing the purpose of the commit.
